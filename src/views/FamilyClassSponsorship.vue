                The main intent of the Canadian family class immigration program
                is to reunite Canadian citizens and permanent residents with
                close members of their family. As stated in the Immigration and
                Refugee Protection Act 3(1)(d), one of the main pillars of
                Canadian immigration system is focused on the reunification of
                families. However, family class sponsorship program has specific
                requirements which the sponsor and the sponsored person have to
                meet.
              </p>
              <p>
                In fact, by signing an agreement which is commonly referred to
                as “undertaking”, the sponsor (a Canadian citizen or permanent
                resident (PR)) promises that their family member will not be a
                burden on Canadian society for the duration of the undertaking.
                Therefore, by making Canadian Citizens or PRs become committed
                in providing basic needs as well as financial or otherwise
                support that are essential for the sponsored person in
                resettling in Canada, the system allows family members to
                immigrate to Canada.

              <p>
                The sponsor is required to sign a Sponsorship Agreement together
                with the sponsored family member(s). By this agreement, the
                sponsor commits himself/herself to provide financial support for
                the basic needs (food, clothing, shelter, and health needs not
                covered by public health services) of the person(s) being
                sponsored.
              </p>

              <p>If you are sponsoring any of the following:</p>

              <div style="margin-left: 20px">
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    A spouse or partner who has a dependent child and that
                    dependent child has one or more children of their own, or
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A dependent child who has one or more dependent children of
                    their own, or
                  </li>
                  <li>A parent or grandparent;</li>

                  common-law partner who is already residing in Canada (such as
                  on a Temporary Residence Permit) can be made in Canada.
                  Sponsoring from within Canada allows the sponsored person to
                  continue to live in Canada while their application for
                  permanent residence is in process. In addition, the sponsored
                  person can apply for an open work permit allowing them to for
                  any employer during the process of their application.

                  <b>Outside Canada:</b> An application for sponsoring a spouse
                  or common-law partner who lives abroad is mainly processed in

                  visit their spouse in Canada before they become permanent
                  resident (example, they may come to Canada for a visit through
