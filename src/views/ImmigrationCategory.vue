            Canada has various pathways of immigration that are suitable ways of
            immigration to many people from across the world. Therefore, Canada
            has many streams of immigration, but among the most popular streams
            of immigration are the following:

                  Skilled Worker Programs: These programs comprise various
                  Federal and Provincial programs that are aimed at admitting
                  qualified and experienced skilled workers from different parts
                  of the world. At the federal level, there are three main
                  categories under one program called <b>EXPRESS ENTRY</b> – A
                  Program run by the Canadian government to fill labour shortage
                  gaps through processing permanent residence application for
                  qualified applicants:
                </p>

                    Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP) – Please put link to
                    this website:
                    https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/skilled-trades.html
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <br />
                <p>
                  At the provincial level, there are also Skilled Worker
                  Programs; <br />

                  In Canada, each province has its own immigration program aimed
                  at filling labor shortages in each province. Each province, in
                  agreement with the federal government, outlines its own
                  immigration program. Some provides apply methods that are
                  similar to the Federal Express Entry methods to select
                  qualified skilled workers, others follow similar or different
                  paths in trying to fill their labor needs. <br />
                  <br />

                  If we take the Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program as an
                  example; (see here:
                  https://immigratemanitoba.com/immigrate-to-manitoba/), the
                  province has Skilled Worker Program, International Education,
                  and Business Program.

              Family Class: Based on the definitions provided on IRPA and IRPR
              (S. 117), Family Class of immigration comprises a path of
              sponsorships aimed at unifying families – a foundational
              infrastructure in the Canadian immigration system. Unlike many
              countries, Canada’s foundation of immigration is aimed at bringing
              families together – families that have been dispersed or divided
              because of political, social, cultural or other factors relevant
              to the regulations (click here to lern particularities of this
              program).
            </li>
            <li>
              Refugee Class: Canada has a very generous system of refugee
              sponsorship programs. This program is designed to help Canadian
              families to sponsor and bring their loved ones to live in the
              healthy and peaceful environment Canadian social environment. As a
              matter of fact, Canada is among the very few countries which
              understands the ordeals of becoming a refugee, and that it takes a
              lion’s share in the global resettlement of refugees. Canadian
              refugee system is based on the global definition of a “refugee” as
              outlined in the Geneva Convention of 1952 which was revisited in
              1967 UNO Protocol.<br />
              A refugee is “a person who has fled his or her own country and
              cannot return due to fear of persecution and has been given
              refugee status”. Refugee status is given to applicants by the
              United Nations or by a third party country of residence. In the
              modern world in which various forms of persecution are paramount,
              Canada remains among the very few global community actors which
              deeply sympathizes with refugees and their cause. But this is only
              if their definition of refugee status based on the IRPR and IRPA
              is consistent. <br />It has to be noted that Canadian Refugee
              Class of immigration has been encountering a lot of changes in the
              course of the last eight or so years. Canada allowed Communities
              to sponsor their refugee members of both nuclear and extended
              family members through a program broadly known as Private
              Sponsorship Program (PSR). However, this has changed recently, and
              Canadian family or friends who would like to sponsor their refugee
              family members through the PSR have been asked to demonstrate
              financial capability that they could show either through their
              income or large amount of trust account deposits. It is a public
              knowledge that this requirement has been creating remarkable
              pressure on Canadian community members who would be desperate to
              save their loved ones from the shackles of desperation,
              persecution, refugee camps that are infested with outlaws (such as
              human traffickers), and more.
            </li>
            <li>
              Temporary Residence Class: This class is concerned with temporary
              residence permit (as authorized by the visa officer at the Port of
              Entry). The most popular permits in this category are Super Visa,
              Visitors’ Visa and Tourist Visa. Again, Canada is among the very
              few countries next to the U.S.A. which allows visit of, among
              others, parents and grandparents to their permanent resident or
              Canadian Citizen Children. Parents or grandparents whose children
              are living in Canada as Permanent Residents or Citizens are
              allowed to come to Canada as temporary residents so long they meet
              the requirements. In addition, Canada, as among the most naturally
              rich countries of the world, it welcomes tourists, visitors or
              anyone who would love to transit through Canada. Therefore,
              temporary residence permit comprises part of the most important
              immigration streams.
