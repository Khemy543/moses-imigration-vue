        immigration to many people from across the world. Therefore, Canada has
        many streams of immigration, but among the most popular streams of
        immigration are the following:

          Skilled Worker Programs: These programs comprise various Federal and
          Provincial programs that are aimed at admitting qualified and
          experienced skilled workers from different parts of the world. At the
          federal level, there are three main categories under one program
          called <b>EXPRESS ENTRY</b> – A Program run by the Canadian government
          to fill labour shortage gaps through processing permanent residence
          application for qualified applicants:

        </ul>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          At the provincial level, there are also Skilled Worker Programs;
          <br />

          In Canada, each province has its own immigration program aimed at
          filling labor shortages in each province. Each province, in agreement
          with the federal government, outlines its own immigration program.
          Some provides apply methods that are similar to the Federal Express
          Entry methods to select qualified skilled workers, others follow
          similar or different paths in trying to fill their labor needs. <br />
          <br />

          If we take the Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program as an example; (see
          here: https://immigratemanitoba.com/immigrate-to-manitoba/), the
          province has Skilled Worker Program, International Education, and
          Business Program.

            Based on the definitions provided on IRPA and IRPR (S. 117), Family
            Class of immigration comprises a path of sponsorships aimed at
            unifying families – a foundational infrastructure in the Canadian
            immigration system. Unlike many countries, Canada’s foundation of
            immigration is aimed at bringing families together – families that
            have been dispersed or divided because of political, social,
            cultural or other factors relevant to the regulations (click here to

        Refugee Class
      </h5>
      <p>
        Canada has a very generous system of refugee sponsorship programs. This
        program is designed to help Canadian families to sponsor and bring their
        loved ones to live in the healthy and peaceful environment Canadian
        social environment. As a matter of fact, Canada is among the very few
        countries which understands the ordeals of becoming a refugee, and that
        it takes a lion’s share in the global resettlement of refugees. Canadian
        refugee system is based on the global definition of a “refugee” as
        outlined in the Geneva Convention of 1952 which was revisited in 1967
        UNO Protocol.<br />
        A refugee is “a person who has fled his or her own country and cannot
        return due to fear of persecution and has been given refugee status”.
        Refugee status is given to applicants by the United Nations or by a
        third party country of residence. In the modern world in which various
        forms of persecution are paramount, Canada remains among the very few
        global community actors which deeply sympathizes with refugees and their
        cause. But this is only if their definition of refugee status based on
        the IRPR and IRPA is consistent. <br />It has to be noted that Canadian
        Refugee Class of immigration has been encountering a lot of changes in
        the course of the last eight or so years. Canada allowed Communities to
        sponsor their refugee members of both nuclear and extended family
        members through a program broadly known as Private Sponsorship Program
        (PSR). However, this has changed recently, and Canadian family or
        friends who would like to sponsor their refugee family members through
        the PSR have been asked to demonstrate financial capability that they
        could show either through their income or large amount of trust account
        deposits. It is a public knowledge that this requirement has been
        creating remarkable pressure on Canadian community members who would be
        desperate to save their loved ones from the shackles of desperation,
        persecution, refugee camps that are infested with outlaws (such as human
        traffickers), and more.

            Temporary Residence Class
          </h5>
          <p>
            This class is concerned with temporary residence visa (as
            authorized by the visa officer at the Port of Entry). The most
            popular permits in this category are Super Visa, Visitors’ Visa and
            Tourist Visa. Again, Canada is among the very few countries next to
            the U.S.A. which allows visit of, among others, parents and
            grandparents to their permanent resident or Canadian Citizen
            Children. Parents or grandparents whose children are living in
            Canada as Permanent Residents or Citizens are allowed to come to
            Canada as temporary residents so long they meet the requirements. In
            addition, Canada, as among the most naturally rich countries of the
            world, it welcomes tourists, visitors or anyone who would love to
            transit through Canada. Therefore, temporary residence visa
            comprises part of the most important immigration streams.
