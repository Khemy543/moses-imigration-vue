                  Holders of open work permits can work for any employer and in any occupation of their choice,
                  which is different than an LMIA-based work permit that only authorizes work for a specific
                  employer. If you are an open work permit holder, you do not need to have a positive LMIA to
                  work for an employer in an occupation of your choice.

                    <b>You may be eligible for an open work permit if, among other classes, you are:</b>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A Temporary Resident permit holder</li>
                        <li>The spouse or common-law partner of a skilled worker or international student</li>
                        <li>
                          A dependent family member (e.g., spouse or common-law partner)Â of a person who
                          has applied for the status of Permanent Resident;
                        </li>
                        <li>A refugee, asylum seeker, protected person or their family member</li>
                        <li>A student who needs humanitarian consideration such as that you are no more able to
                          meet the financial needs of studies; and</li>
                        <li>An international student who has graduated from a designated educational institution.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div>
                  In some of the above-mentioned categories, you may apply for work permit either from within
                  Canada or from outside Canada.
                    <h5 class="text-center">Spousal Open Work Permit under the Family Class</h5>

                    <p>
                      Spouses or common-law-partners of Canadian citizens or Permanent Residents who are already
                      in Canada may be issued an open work permit during the process of their in-Canada spousal
                      sponsorship application. They need to meet all the eligibility criteria, and their application for
                      open work permit would be ideally submitted along with their sponsorship application for
                      Permanent Resident. <br><br>
