                  Holders of open work permits can work for any employer and in any occupation of their choice,
                  which is different than an LMIA-based work permit that only authorizes work for a specific
                  employer. If you are an open work permit holder, you do not need to have a positive LMIA to
                  work for an employer in an occupation of your choice.
