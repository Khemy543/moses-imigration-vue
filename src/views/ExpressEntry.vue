            Each of these streams have minimum requirements applicants must meet
            before they apply. The most important requirements are related to
            level of education, English and/or French language skills, skilled
            work experience and age. Express Entry streams are point based, and
            you will be assessed on a point grid that is calculated through a
            Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) –

            for access to the ranking tool. <br /><br />

            Express Entry draws are regularly administered by the Canadian
            Government. Candidates with the highest CRS scores are invited to
            submit applications for Permanent Residence (PR). After receiving an
            invitation and submitting an application package for PR, the
            approval process is often less than a year.

              General Overview of Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP)
            </h5>

            <p>
              This program is for skilled workers with foreign work experience.
              The program’s requirements are dependent on several factors.
              Minimum requirements are: level of education; skilled work
              experience; and English and/or French Language skills (Reading,
              Writing, Speaking and Listening skills). <br /><br />

              <b
                >The Program is based on a 100-point grid (as of now, the pass
                mark is 67; but this may change any time) for which the
                following are important contributing factors:</b
              >
              <br /><br />

              <b>Level of education:</b> Points are awarded for educational
              levels of high school and above. If education was attained in
              Canada, the applicant must present certificate, diploma or degree
              awarded from a Canadian educational institution for secondary or
              post-secondary education. If such credentials were acquired from
              outside Canada, then the applicant must have an Educational
              Credential Assessment (ECA) report for immigration purposes from a
              designated organization showing that your education is equal to a
              completed certificate, diploma or degree from a Canadian
              institution at a secondary or post-secondary school level.
              <br /><br />

              <b>Work Experience:</b> Whether acquired within Canada or outside
              Canada, a minimum of 1 year full-time skilled work experience.
              Work experience shall be in skilled work areas under the National
              Occupational Classification (NOC) skill level 0, A or B. Full-time
              work is defined as 30hrs/per week or more OR an equal amount in
              part-time (example: 15hrs/week for 2 years). If you have a
              full-time and non-seasonal job offer from a Canadian employer
              valid at least for 1 year, you are awarded more points.
              Specification of job offers by Canadian employers are eligible for
              points.
            </p>
            <br /><br />

            <b>Language Skills:</b> In this program, you are expected to
            demonstrate adequate language skills in at least one of the two
            Canadian official languages – English and/or French. The four
            language skills are: listening, writing, speaking and reading. Among
            the most widely accepted language certificates to support Canadian
            immigration are (certificate shall not be older than two years):
            <ul>
              <li>
                CELPIP: Canadian English Language Proficiency Index Program
              </li>
              <li>TEF Canada: Test d&#39;évaluation de français</li>
              <li>IELTS: International English Language Testing System</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              The test results are calculated based on the Canadian Language
              Benchmark (CLB) for English and Niveaux de compétence linguistique
              canadiens (NCLC) for French. The required language level in all
              four of the language skills is CLB = 7 or NCLC = 7. To be awarded
              points for a second official language, you must have at least CLB=
              5 or NCLC =5 in all four skills.
