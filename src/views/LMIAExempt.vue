                  In certain circumstances, Foreign Nationals (workers) may obtain a work permit without LMIA
                  approval (exemption). Where an LMIA exemption applies, it is possible for the Foreign National
                  to be issued a work permit that allows them to work in Canada for a specific period.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Such permits are based on bilateral or multilateral agreements between Canada and other
                  countries. The most important international agreements that may be applicable for LMIA exempt
                  work permits are the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA)</li>
                  <li>North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)</li>
                  <li>Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)</li>
                </ul>
              <p>

                <b>LMIA-Exempt work permits fall under the International Mobility Program (IMP)</b>. While
                the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) assists Canadian employers fill vacant jobs
                with temporary foreign workers where qualified Canadians or permanent residents were not
                available, IMP is aimed at benefitting Canada on a broader context. Among others, IMP
                stimulates the social, cultural and economic benefits of Canada.

                Moses Canadian Immigration Consulting Services can assist you in determining your eligibility for and applying to this program. <RouterLink
