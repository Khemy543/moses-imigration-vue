                  The Government of Canada is currently offering 11 Canadian communities the opportunity to
                  select Foreign Nationals who could fill their local employment vacancies through the Rural and
                  Northern Immigration Pilot (RNIP). These communities welcome skilled foreign nationals
                  who immigrate through this pilot program, and assist them in their settlement into the given
                  community.
                </p>
                <p><b>The 11 participating communities are:</b></p>
